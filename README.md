# Content-Summary-Generator
Content Summary Generator is an automatic summarization tool that generates a gist of any given text corpus. With a ready-to-use 
GUI this application will use two algorithms, Text Rank or the proposed algorithm to generate the summary. Customization is pivotal 
this project and you will find several options like editing stop words, short forms, heavy-words, reduction ratio, etc in the 
application.

Feel free to post your queries and I will try to solve them to the best of my abilities.
